        <p>Hey there! I'm Tyler. I'm a husband and father to 2 beautiful girls. I'm a Florida native currently living on the Southwest coast. </p>
        <p>I like to watch anime and, if I have the time, play video games, but I'm also a soccer fan. I cook for a living but have decided I don't want to work in the foodservice industry anymore.</p>
        <p>I do however like to get creative in the kitchen, and my older daughter has even started baking (and quite honestly she's better than I am)</p>
        <p>I don't really have a specific goal for learning coding, it has always been an interest of mine since I grew up with a computer and playing games and such. I always wanted to know how it all worked.</p>
